# Parallelizing the Trapping Rainwater Problem
We will be implementing a parallelized version of the rainwater trapping problem. The problem consists of finding the maximum amount of rainwater that can be trapped between two solid surfaces after rainfall without overflowing. The solid walls are represented by arrays where the value in the array is equal to the wall height and on a graph by blocks with width of one unit; rainwater contained is the space between two equal height solid surfaces, and the total rainwater trapped is the sum of all regions of trapped rainwater
